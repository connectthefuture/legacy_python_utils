	 Usually this error message should be ignored.
	It occurs when the FLEXnet Licensing error message function was called
	though no error was detected.
	The license files (or license server system network addresses) attempted are 
	listed below.  Use LM_LICENSE_FILE to use a different license file,
	or contact your software provider for a license file.
There is a license server manager/vendor daemon running, but it's for
other vendors.
The license key and data for the feature do not match.
	This usually happens when a license file has been altered.
	The hostid of this system does not match the hostid
	specified in the license file.
	The lookup for the hostname on the SERVER line in the
	license file failed.  This often happens when NIS or DNS
	or the hosts file is incorrect.  Workaround: Use IP-Address
	(e.g., 123.456.789.123) instead of hostname.
	The license server manager (lmgrd) has not been started yet,
	the wrong port@host or license file is being used, or the
	port or hostname in the license file has been changed.
	The license server system appears to be running, but is not
	responding.  If this persists, notify the System Administrator.
	(The license server manager (lmgrd) and vendor daemon processes
	should be terminated and restarted.)
	This error can occur because the license server system isn't running, or
	the FLEXenabled application needs to add @localhost with the
	lmpath command.
lmutil lmborrow -startupdate was issued but not updated yet.
To override this, stop and restart the license server system.
WARNING: overriding may cause loss of licenses.
The file was issued for a later version of FLEXnet Licensing than this
program understands.
This is a warning condition.  The license server system has pooled one
or more INCREMENT lines into a single pool, and the request was made on
an INCREMENT line that has been pooled.  If this is reported as an
error, it's an internal error.
The license file indicates THIS_HOST, and the server is not
running on this host.  If it's running on a different host, 
THIS_HOST should be changed to the correct host.
See the system adminstrator about starting the license server system, or
make sure you're referring to the right host (see LM_LICENSE_FILE).
Check the lmgrd log file, or try lmreread.
The system administrator has reserved all the licenses for others.
Reservations are made in the options file. The license server system must
be restarted for options file changes to take effect.
Retry the checkout again for a shorter period.
The vendor daemon can't handle any more users.


See the license server manager (lmgrd) debug log for further information.
 Either the hardware dongle is not attached, or the necessary
 software driver for this dongle type is not installed.
 When linking Windows binaries, you must link with lmgr.lib as
 well as lmgr.res.
 In order to read the dongle hostid, the correct driver must be
 installed.  These drivers are available at www.macrovision.com
 or from your software vendor.
 This is probably because the license is older than the application
 You need to obtain a SIGN= version of this license from your vendor.
 Use lmstat to find the users that have the licenses borrowed.
Trusted Storage is invalid, and needs to be repaired.
Trusted Storage contains a fulfillment record which is invalid.
The return is not allowed because one or more fulfillment record counts
would exceed the allowed maximum.
There are no repairs left to service this repair request.
SUPERSEDE and SUPERSEDE_SIGN can not be used at the same time.
Invalid syntax for SUPERSEDE_SIGN={"feature1:signature" "feature2:signature" ....}
Feature name and signature are required for SUPERSEDE_SIGN
